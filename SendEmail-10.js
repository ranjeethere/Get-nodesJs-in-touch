//The Nodemailer Module
The Nodemailer module makes it easy to send emails from your computer.

The Nodemailer module can be downloaded and installed using npm:

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install nodemailer
After you have downloaded the Nodemailer module, you can include the module in any application:

var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
Send an Email
Now you are ready to send emails from your server.

Use the username and password from your selected email provider to send an email. This tutorial will show you how to use your Gmail account to send an email:

ExampleGet your own Node.js Server
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
    pass: 'yourpassword'
  }
});

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
  text: 'That was easy!'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
  }
});
And that's it! Now your server is able to send emails.

Multiple Receivers
To send an email to more than one receiver, add them to the "to" property of the mailOptions object, separated by commas:

Example
Send email to more than one address:

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com, myotherfriend@yahoo.com',
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
  text: 'That was easy!'
}
Send HTML
To send HTML formatted text in your email, use the "html" property instead of the "text" property:

Example
Send email containing HTML:

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
  html: '<h1>Welcome</h1><p>That was easy!</p>'
}
